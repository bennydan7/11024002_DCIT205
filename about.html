          This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
          Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
          society is to take full advantage <br />
          of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid
          economic advances. Computer science involves the study and development
          of <br />
          applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the
          software systems that support these applications, and the means and
          methods used to produce <br />both applications and systems that
          behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer
          Science lies the skill of computer programming and <br />
          employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with
          knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply
          sound engineering principles <br />
          to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.

          The range of courses available in the department and the skills
          acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse
          fields of the economy <br />
          and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a
          project team (or research and development team), and to enable the
          graduate to bring <br />
          specialist skills to that team. The course also provides the platform
          for further study or research through exposure to established and
          emerging technologies <br />
          and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer Science.
