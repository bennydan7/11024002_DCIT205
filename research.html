               This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
               Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
               society is to take full advantage <br />
               of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid
               economic advances. Computer science involves the study and development
               of <br />
               applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the
               software systems that support these applications, and the means and
               methods used to produce <br />both applications and systems that
               behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer
               Science lies the skill of computer programming and <br />
               employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with
               knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply
               sound engineering principles <br />
               to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.
