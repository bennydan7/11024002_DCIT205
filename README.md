## Getting Started

# Introduction

This website stands as a culmination of my interim assessment, representing a dynamic project aimed at bringing the Computer Science Department into the digital spotlight. Its core purpose is not only to showcase the department but also to immerse visitors in a rich experience encompassing diverse facets such as the catalog, resources, upcoming events, and essential contact information. Crafted with an emphasis on user engagement, seamless navigation, and the delivery of comprehensive information, this website aims to be a virtual hub for all things related to the Computer Science Department.
